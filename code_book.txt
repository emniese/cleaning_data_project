This code book contains information about the 20 data columns in the tidyset.txt data set.  


There are 30 subjects, numbered 1-30.  

The six activities each subject engaged in are: Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking up, and Walking down.

The remaining 18 columns contain the mean of each feature grouped by subject and activity. 

The feature column headings and description are:

tBodyAccMag-mean(), Mean of the mean acceleration of the subject's body 
tGravityAccMag-mean(), Mean of the mean  acceleration of subject due to gravity 
tBodyAccJerkMag-mean(), Mean of the mean  jerk of the subject 
tBodyGyroMag-mean(), Mean of the mean  gyroscope reading
tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean(), Mean of the mean  gyroscope jerk
fBodyAccMag-mean(), Mean of the mean body acceleration after Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean(), Mean of the mean jerk of the subject after FFT
fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean(), Mean of the mean gyroscope reading after FFT
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-Mean(), Mean of the mean gyroscope jerk after FFT
tBodyAccMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of body acceleration
tGravityAccMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of acceleration due to gravity
tBodyAccJerkMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of the jerk of the subject
tBodyGyroMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of the gyroscope reading
tBodyGyroJerkMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of the gyroscope jerk
fBodyAccMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of the body acceleration after FFT
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of the jerk of the subject after FFT
fBodyBodyGyroMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of the gyroscope reading after FFT
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std(), Mean of the standard deviation of gyroscope jerk after FFT
